# Sector-wise Revenue Expenditure Analysis of Indian States and UTs
This project explores, analyzes, and visualizes sector-wise revenue expenditure across Indian states and union territories. Using Python's data science stack, the goal is to uncover trends, compare regional allocations, test statistical hypotheses, and detect relationships in spending patterns.

## üìå Objectives
1. Generate descriptive statistics and identify key trends, distributions, and inconsistencies in sector-wise revenue expenditure.
2. Design and implement visual representations using Matplotlib and Seaborn for comparing sector-wise allocations across years and regions.
3. Conduct statistical hypothesis testing to evaluate significant differences in revenue expenditure patterns between selected sectors or regions.
4. Uncover relationships and correlations among sectors through numerical and visual statistical analysis.
5. Analyze year-on-year changes in sector-wise revenue expenditure to detect growth patterns, stagnation, or shifts in spending priorities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
